The definitions and defalut values for the following parameters 
are given in Section 7 of UserGuide.pdf of MATLAB version of SparsePOP:

relaxOrder
sparseSW
multiCliquesFactor
scalingSW
boundSW 
eqTolerance
perturbation
reduceMomentMatSW
complementaritySW
SDPsolverSW
SDPsolverOutFile
detailedInfFile
sdpaDataFile
printFileName
printLevel1
printLevel2


The definition and defalut value for the following parameter 
are not given in UserGuide.pdf of MATLAB version of SparsePOP, 
but is defined in MATLAB version of SparsePOP:

reduceAMatSW	: If 1 (default), then
			(a) Eliminate some fixed variables from a POP before applying the 
			sparse SDP relaxation,  
			(b) When the equality constraints of the SeDuMi format primal SDP
			are linearly dependent, eliminated some equalities to restore 
			the linear independence.
		= 0 for no (a) and (b);
		= 1 for (a) and (b);


The following parameters are not defined in MATLAB version of SparsePOP:

printOnScreen	: If 1 (default), then the result of SparsePOP is displayed 
			on the screen.
		: If 0 , then the result is not displayed on the screen.

SDPAOnScreen	: If 1 (default), then the result of SDPA is displayed 
			on the screen.
		  If 0, then the result is not displayed on the screen. 

Method		: If `symamd' (default), then 
			SparsePOP uses symamd in COLAMD for finding the sparsity 
			of a given POP.
		  If `metis', then 
			SparsePOP uses metis for finding the sparsity of a given POP.

The following parameters are defined in MATLAB and C++ versions of SparsePOP,
but the definitions are not described in UserGuide.pdf. 
			
binarySW       : If 1 (default), then a reduction for a POP which has 
                 constraint "x^2 = x" works for the resulting SDP
                 relaxation problems.
               : If 0, then no reduction.

SquareOneSW    : If 1 (default), then a reduction for a POP which has 
                 constraint "x^2 = 1" works for the resulting SDP
                 relaxation problems.
               : If 0, then no reduction.

These reductions are based on the following paper:
J.B.Lasserre, "An explicit equivalent positive semidefinite
program for nonlinear 0-1 programs", SIAM J.Optim., 12, 
pp. 756--769.
However, these reductions do not work when user computes error 
bounds of an approximated solution obtained by SparsePOP.
